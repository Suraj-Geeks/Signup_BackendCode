To push your local project code to your GitHub repository, follow these steps:
✅ Step 1: Initialize Git (If Not Already Done)
Open the terminal in your project folder and run:git init
*This initializes a Git repository in your project folder.

✅ Step 2: Connect to Your GitHub Repository
If you haven’t created a GitHub repository yet:

Go to GitHub and create a new repository.
Copy the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git).
In your terminal, add the remote repository:git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git


To check if the remote was added correctly:git remote -v

✅ Step 3: Add and Commit Your Code
Add all files to Git tracking:  git add .

Commit your changes with a meaningful message: git commit -m "Initial commit"

Step 4: Push Code to GitHub
Now, push your code to GitHub:git push -u origin main

(If your default branch is master, replace main with master.)
